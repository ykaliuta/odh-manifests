  description: Import a notebook in Watson Studio and use AutoAI to build and deploy a model. 
  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start walks you through importing a Notebook in Watson Studio, building a model with AutoAI, and deploying a model.
    Build, run and manage AI models, and optimize decisions at scale across any cloud. IBM Watson Studio empowers you to operationalize AI anywhere as part of IBM Cloud Pak® for Data,
    the IBM data and AI platform. Unite teams, simplify AI lifecycle management and accelerate time to value with an open, flexible multicloud architecture.

        ### Create a project
        1. Click **Projects** &#x2192; **View all projects** from the menu.
        2. Click **New project**.
        3. Select **Analytics project** and click **OK**.
        4. Add a title and description, then click **Create**.
      summary:
        success: You have created a new project
        failed: Try the steps again
    - title: Add data to your project
      description: |-
        ### After you create a project, add data assets to it so that you can work with data
        1. From your project’s **Assets** page, click **Add to project** &#x2192; **Data**.
        2. In the **Load** pane that opens, browse for a CSV file or drag it from your file manager onto the pane.
      summary:
        success: The files are listed as data assets on the **Assets** page of your project.
        failed: Try the steps again
    - title: Import a notebook into your project
      description: |-
        ### After you have data assets you are ready to import a notebook
        1. From your project, click **Add to Project** &#x2192; **Notebook**.
        2. On the **New Notebook** page, upload a notebook file from your file system, or by using a URL.
        3. Specify the runtime environment for the language you want to use (Python, R, or Scala).
        4. Click **Create Notebook**.
      summary:
        success: The notebook opens in the Jupyter notebook editor.
        failed: Try the steps again
    - title: Load data into your notebook
      description: |-
        ### After you have a notebook created you can load data into the notebook
        1. Click in an empty code cell in your notebook.
        2. Click the **Find and Add Data** icon.
        3. Click **Insert to code** &#x2192; **pandas DataFrame** right below the data file name.
        4. Run the cell.
      summary:
        success: The data is now loaded into the notebook and you can see a preview of the data. Run the rest of the notebook to train your model.
        failed: Try the steps again
    - title: Train an AutoAI model
      description: |-
        ### As an alternative to the notebook, you can build a model with AutoAI
        1. From the **Assets** page of your project, click **Add to Project** &#x2192; **AutoAI experiment**.
        2. Name your experiment, then click **Create**.
        3. Upload or add a CSV file from project to train the experiment.
        4. Select the prediction column.
        5. Run the experiment.
      summary:
        success: You have trained a model with AutoAI.
        failed: Try the steps again
    - title: Save and deploy a model
      description: |-
        ### After a model is trained with AutoAI, you can deploy it
        1. After the AutoAI experiment finishes training, select the best performing pipeline and click **Save as model**.
        2. A notification indicates the model is saved. Click the **View in project** link in the notification to open the model details page.
        3. Create a deployment space, and then promote the model to the deployment space.
        4. Click the link in the success notification to open the model in the deployment space.
        5. Create and name a new deployment of the model.
        6. When the deployment is ready, click the deployment name and choose **Online** as the deployment type, assigning a name for the deployment.
        7. When the deployment is ready, click the name to view and test the deployment.
        8. Click the **Test** tab and use the form interface to enter test values.
        9. Click **Predict** to view the prediction.
      summary:
        success: You have deployed an AutoAI model.
        failed: Try the steps again
  conclusion: You are now able to import a notebook in Watson Studio, build, and deploy a model.
